# Application-Security-Tool

A beginner-friendly tool designed to identify basic application vulnerabilities, including verifying the integrity of files by calculating their SHA256 hash. This project demonstrates the use of hashing techniques in cybersecurity to ensure that files have not been tampered with.

## Features
- Calculates the SHA256 hash of a file.
- Verifies the integrity of files by comparing hash values.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script in a terminal/command prompt:
   ```bash
   python hash_checker.py
   
Enter the full path to the file you want to check (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\testfile.txt).
The script will display the SHA256 hash of the file:

Enter the file path to check its hash: C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\testfile.txt
SHA256 Hash of C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\testfile.txt: d2a5f2f59f... (hash value)

About
This script is part of a personal project created to showcase basic application security skills and understanding of cryptographic techniques, focusing on the verification of file integrity using hashing.
