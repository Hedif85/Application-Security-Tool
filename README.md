# Hash Checker

A Python script to calculate the hash (SHA256) of a file to verify its integrity. This project demonstrates the use of hashing techniques commonly used in cybersecurity to check if a file has been modified.

## Features
- Calculates the SHA256 hash of a file.
- Verifies the integrity of files by comparing hash values.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script in a terminal/command prompt:
   ```bash
   python hash_checker.py

3. Enter the full path to the file you want to check (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\testfile.txt).

Enter the file path to check its hash: C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\testfile.txt
SHA256 Hash of C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\testfile.txt: d2a5f2f59f... (hash value)
